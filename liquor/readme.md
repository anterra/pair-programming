# Linear Regression Dataset Challenge

Using the provided dataset on liquor store sales, build and evaluate models to predict year end sales. Use as much boilerplate/pre-written code from the sample code/lessons/your projects/etc.

You can get *very* high r2 vales for this dataset; don't stop there.
